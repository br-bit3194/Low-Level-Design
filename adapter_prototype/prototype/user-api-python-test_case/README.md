# Prototype Pattern for Object Cloning in Testing

## Problem Statement
You are developing a testing framework for a user API of a social media platform. Each test case requires generating multiple mock users with different attributes to simulate various scenarios. However, creating mock users for testing involves complex setups and is time-consuming. To optimize the user creation process during testing, you decide to implement the Prototype pattern. This pattern allows you to create prototype objects and clone them when needed, avoiding the overhead of setting up complex user objects repeatedly.

## Assignment
Your task is to implement the Prototype pattern to create prototype objects for mock users in the testing framework. There is a `Cloneable` interface that contains the `clone` method, which should be implemented by user objects. Additionally, you need to implement a `UserPrototypeRegistry` interface that provides methods for adding and retrieving user prototypes and for cloning user objects. The goal is to simplify the process of creating users with specific attributes.

## Implementing the Prototype Pattern

1. **Review the `Cloneable` interface**: Have a look at the interface named `Cloneable` with a single method, `clone_object()`, that returns a cloned copy of the implementing object.

2. **Implement the `clone_object()` method**: Review the `User` class with attributes for the app. Implement the `clone_object()` from the `Cloneable` interface. Your method should create a new `User` object and copy the attribute values from the original object to the new object. Return the new object as the cloned copy. You can either implement the cloning logic or use a library like `copy` clone the object. You can use any of shallow or deep cop.

3. **Review the `UserPrototypeRegistry` interface**: See the interface named `UserPrototypeRegistry` that includes methods for adding prototypes, retrieving prototypes by type, and cloning user objects.

4. **Complete the registry implementation**: A class that inherits from the `UserPrototypeRegistry` interface is present in the codebase. However, the methods are not implemented. You need to implement the methods to manage user prototypes and perform cloning operations. In this class, manage a collection of user prototypes and provide methods to add prototypes, retrieve prototypes by type, and clone user objects based on their type.

## Instructions
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Implement the Prototype pattern by completing the `clone_object()` method in the `User` class. 
3. Implement the `UserPrototypeRegistry` interface to manage user prototypes and perform cloning operations. Complete the methods in the `UserPrototypeRegistryImpl` class.
4. Run the provided test cases in the `TestUserPrototypeRegistryImpl` class to validate the correctness of your prototype pattern implementation. Ensure that user objects can be cloned successfully, and that the registry functions as expected.
